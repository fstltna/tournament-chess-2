<p>
Enter <b>Tournament Chess II</b> and try your skills against Global Star's innovative chess engine <A href="#Engine">"<b>Treebeard</b>"</A>. You can access this engine directly in the practice mode or (if you prefer) as a human player within the rich 3D virtual world, with opponents that are presented as characters in the game.
<p>
You start in the "home" environment, where you can play a few friends. As you win games your rating goes up and stronger players arrive to play you. Watch your position change in the rankings ladder among the computer players. As you play into the night, notice that the light room gets darker as your virtual world changes with your real world! Fiddle with the lights, turn on the fire and try different stunning Chess sets and boards. Switch to playing one of the five fun games, such as Swap or Losing Chess. Hone your skills ready for the next level...!<br><br>

<IMG src="chess1.bmp"><br>

As you get stronger, your ranking will reach the level that earns you an invite to play at the club. Your opposition is now getting tougher! With a few wins behind you, you get an invite to the club championship. This is much harder, but if you are made of the right stuff, your climb up the rankings will take you to play in the <b>World Professional Chess Tournament</b>.<br><br>

<IMG src="chess2.bmp"><br>

Here you will meet some formidable opposition that will show you whether you can really play or not! This time you will not be alone, as an audience watches your game. Press home your game and prove your quality as you finally take home the <b>World Chess Tournament trophy</b>!

<a name="Who"> <h1> <b> Who can you play? </b> </h1> </a> 
  
In <b>Tournament Chess II</b> you can play the engine directly in the practice mode, or you can choose to play a variety of players of different strengths and styles provided. These start in the "home" room with the beginner "Trixy". If you are a serious player then you will not find her very hard to beat! Beyond her it gets progressively harder with Uncle George, Joe, then Harry (who likes to play less popular opening lines, and with a maverick style). As you play new opponents you meet a mixture of differing play styles, each becoming gradually stronger.

<IMG src="characters.bmp"><br>

By the time you get to the club, many more players appear, each (again) with their own style of play. By the time you get past the club, you will have met over 30 players. Watch these players in the serious matches! When they need to win, they choose a different style to when they play casual games! When a match is on they will adapt their play style depending on the position in the match!
<p>
If you progress well in the club, and your ranking is strong enough, you will earn your invitation to the <b>World Professional Chess Tournament</b>, where you will still meet some players similar to the club, but also seriously strong players that will not surrender their games easily! By this stage you will have met over 80 computer opponents in total!
</p>

<p><b>Do the computer players get to play among themselves?</b> Too right! Between games you may see that some of the computer player's ratings have changed. Each time you play, other matches take place and computer players will be winning and losing games against each other.</p>

<a name="Learn"> <h1> <b> How can I learn to play? </b> </h1> </a> 

<b>Tournament Chess II</b> provides on-line help to learn the rules of Chess, but you can also quickly learn how the pieces move by simply touching a piece with the mouse pointer. This will illuminate the squares where the piece can reach.<br><br>

However learning is best carried out in <b>Practice Mode</b>, where the <b>Chess Coach</b> will be there to help you. If you make a mistake or a poor move, the coach will automatically step in and advise you. You can then get a suggestion from the coach, take the move back or continue with you move. If you do not understand why the move was bad, then you can play it and see what happens. When the reason becomes clear, you can then take back your moves to the point where the bad move was made, and choose a new move.<br><br>

Of course you may not know what move to play at all! In this case you can select "Hint" from the menu (or type the shortcut key "H"). The coach will then show a good move to play on the board.<br><br>

In practice mode you can also see what your opponent is thinking! Watch the board while your opponent is calculating a move. The computer's current best move is shown by highlighting the "to" and "from" square of that move.<br><br>

While you are learning, you will probably want to choose to play against a weak opponent. You can do this by setting the strength using the slider control. You can also force the computer to play with reduced knowledge, so that you can remove knowledge of (for example) pawn structure or pins. As you get more comfortable you can than turn the knowledge back on and see how your computer opponent changes its style of play.<br><br>

<a name="Chess1"> <h1><b>Basic Chess Game Rules</b></h1>

Chess is a very old and intellectual game, believed to have originated in India or Persia in the fifth century. It eventually spread through Europe where they gave the name of each piece to which we all know today. Chess has now been studied for centuries and has amassed more literature describing and analyzing it than any other game.<br><br>

The game of Chess is a contest between two players, one with white and the other with an equivalent set of black pieces. Players take alternate turns to move their pieces. A move can involve either moving a piece from one square to another (empty) square, or capturing an opponent's piece (which is then removed from the board). The object of the game is to attack and checkmate the opponent's king. To do this requires careful strategy and tactics to maneuver your pieces so that a successful attack can be made. To achieve this requires careful play, where the initial goals must be to control space and gain material (by capturing your opponent's pieces), before a successful mating attack can be mounted.<br><br>

Traditionally the pieces in chess represent figures from medieval history. The following sections describe how these pieces move.<br>


<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->

<a name="Chess_pawn"> <h1><b>Pawn Moves</b></h1>

The <b>Pawns</b> symbolize laborers or soldiers. They are the most numerous of your forces, so you are provided with 8 of them. They move in a forward direction, one square at a time. On their first move the pawn can also optionally move forward two squares. These forward moves cannot be capture moves, but pawns can capture pieces in a forward-diagonal direction (but not move in that direction).  When a pawn reaches the other end of the board it can be changed for any other piece of its own color, except the King of course. This is called “promotion.”  Therefore, a pawn can be promoted to a Queen, a Rook, a Bishop or a Knight. Normally a pawn is promoted to a Queen. A pawn is promoted by removing it from the board and placing the chosen piece on the promotion square.<br><br>

The pawn has one extra move, introduced in Europe in the 19th century, the "en-passant" rule. This states that a double pawn move can be immediately  captured by an opponent's pawn, if that pawn is adjacent to the double pawn move after the move (on its 5th rank). In practice this means that the opponent can play the normal capture that would have been available if the pawn had only advanced one square. On the board the en-passant capture moves the capturing pawn behind the double-move pawn, and then removes it.

The diagram shows examples of the pawn's non-capture moves.<br><br>

<IMG src="pawn_move.bmp"><br>


<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->

<a name="Chess_knight"> <h1><b>Knight Moves</b></h1>

The <b>Knight</b> resembles a horse, and symbolises the medieval Knight on horseback. Its motion is unusual in that it does not move in a straight line, but makes a double move, with a single straight and single diagonal move. This "L-shaped" move can be in any direction, giving 8 possible moves when the knight is near the centre of the board. Similar to a real horse, Knights can jump over chess pieces of the same or opposite colour.  If the knight starts off on a light square, when it has finished its move it will land on a dark square. The diagram below shows all eight possible moves.<br><br>

<IMG src="knight_move.bmp"><br>.
<br><br>
<br><br>


<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->

<a name="Chess_rook_bishop"> <h1><b>Rook and Bishop Moves</b></h1>

The <b>Castle</b> is also known as a “<b>Rook</b>”. These symbolize the fortress of the king and can move any number of squares in a horizontal or vertical direction. It cannot pass through or "jump" pieces as the knight can.<br><br>

<IMG src="rook_move.bmp"><br><br>

The <b>Bishop</b> symbolize the church during medieval times. The bishop is similar to the castle or rook, except that it only moves in a diagonal direction. The next piece, the queen, combines all the moves of the bishop and the rook.

<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->

<a name="Chess_queen"> <h1><b>Queen Moves</b></h1>

The <b>Queen</b> is a very powerful piece and symbolizes the medieval queen, often a very powerful historical figure. She has the ability to move in a horizontal, vertical and a diagonal path across any number of spaces as long as she is not blocked. The queen therefore combines the moves of the rook and bishop. The queen is a formidable piece, and will often be central in many attacks. <br><br>

<IMG src="queen_move.bmp"><br>.
<br><br>
<br><br>


<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->

<a name="Chess_king"> <h1><b>King Moves</b></h1>

The <b>King</b> is the main object of your opponent's attacks. Once checkmated, the game is over! It can move in all possible eight diagonal and horizontal directions, but only one square at a time. The king needs to be protected, but can also become a powerful attacking piece. In the end game it will offer a formidable attacking piece against enemy pawns. In simple mating endgames, it will form part of the mating attack.

<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->

<a name="Chess_mate"></a> <h1><b>Check and Checkmate</b></h1>

When the King is being attacked directly by an opponent’s piece, we say that the King is in “check”.  If the king is in check it must be made safe immediately.<br><br>

There are 3 ways to get out of check:<br><br>

1. The King may move to a square that is not being attacked by an enemy piece.<br><br>

2. The piece that is attacking the King can be captured.<br><br>

3. A piece may be moved between the King and the enemy piece to block the check.<br><br>

If the King is in check and cannot get out, then we say the King is “checkmated” and the game is lost. <br><br>

Now that you know the basics, you are ready to play “Tournament Chess II”!

<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->

<a name="BankRank"></a> <h1><b>Back Rank Chess</b></h1>

<b>Back rank Chess</b> differs from Chess in two rules:<br><br>
1. Check is never allowed<br>
2. To win you have to get your king to the other end of the board (8th rank)<br><br>

This simple set of rule changes results in a rather different game, in which the king becomes very powerful, and in which material becomes less important! You may be surprised how strange this game is! If no pawn moves, king moves or captures occurs after 20 moves, then the game is drawn.

<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->

<a name="Swapchess"></a> <h1><b>Swap Chess</b></h1>

<b>Swap Chess</b> differs from Chess in one extra rule:<br><br>
1. A player can "capture" one of their own pieces, but the effect of the capture is simply to swap the positions of those two pieces. You are restricted only that you cannot swap a pawn to the back rank to instantly promote.<br><br>
2. Castling is not allowed (but actually is not needed).
<br><br>

This extra rule (1) has profound impact on the game and makes the game much more dynamic. The resulting play style has something of the character of Shogi (Japanese Chess), which is a very lively tactical game. The queen and other pieces become more powerful as they can be used to "teleport" pieces across the board. For example a queen on the seventh rank can swap with a pawn on the second rank, threatening a pawn promotion! Also damage to the pawns around the king can be repaired! A piece can be used to shuffle pawns around. Pieces need no longer be cramped or trapped, as they can swap their way out. Of course the king is harder to catch as your opponent can re-arrange pieces that defend it, and the king can bury itself with ease! In this respect the king's defensive position can take on the character of Shogi "castles", which can be hard to attack.<br><br>
Try your hand at this game. It may be much harder than you think!

<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->

<a name="Randomchess"> <h1><b>Random Chess</b></h1>

In <b>Random Chess</b> the pieces on the back rank are randomly shuffled before play. Both sides are given the same configuration. This allows the player to practice their adaptive Chess skills in different tactical situations, without the benefit of book knowledge.<br>
<br>

<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->

<a name="Losingchess"> <h1><b>Losing Chess</b></h1>

<b>Losing Chess</b> is a crazy game where the object is to lose all your pieces! It might sound hard to force your opponent to take your pieces, but there is an additional rule that makes captures compulsory! Now a piece may find itself on an endless trail of captures that it cannot avoid! The winner is the player with no pieces (the king can be captured). If no pawn is advanced or capture made in 20 moves, then the player with the least pieces wins.
<br>

<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->

<a name="Rifle"> <h1><b>Rifle Chess</b></h1>

<b>Rifle Chess</b> was devised in 1921 by W. J. Seabrook and differs from Chess in that captures do not move the piece that is capturing. i.e. N f1xg3 would leave the knight on f1, not g3. This means that a piece can camp near the enemy pieces and capture a number of pieces without moving. Capture therefore does not allow recapture. The king must still be mated in the normal way.

<a name="Timers"><h1> <b> Game Timers </b> </h1>

<b>Tournament Chess II</b> contains many settings for customizing time control during games.  Whether you want a quick fire blitz game, or a marathon tournament game, it's easy to set up.  Below is a list of timer modes for both Human and Computer players, how they behave, and any restrictions they may have:<BR><BR>

<b>Blitz:</b> Human or Computer - Allowed in Competitive Matches<BR><BR>
The Blitz timer works by giving a player an initial chunk of time to play all of their moves, and then a time bonus after each move played.  When it is your turn to play, the timer will count down.  When you eventually make a move, the timer will stop and you will receive the time bonus.  If your timer reaches 0 seconds you have lost the game, so always keep an eye on how much time you have remaining (shown on your player indicator at the bottom of the screen next to your name).  When selecting the Blitz timer from the <b>Timer Mode</b> menu, you can change the Blitz timer settings by clicking on the <b>Time Controls</b> button at the bottom.<BR><BR>

<b>Tournament:</b> Human or Computer - Allowed in Competitive Matches<BR><BR>
The Tournament timer works by splitting the game into batches of moves.  You will be given an initial amount of time <b>(STAGE 1)</b> to complete your first 40 moves.  Once these have been completed, a second amount of time <b>(STAGE 2)</b> will be added to your clock to last you for the next 20 moves.  Again, once these 20 moves have been completed, a third amount of time <b>(STAGE 3)</b> will be added to your timer to last you the next 20 moves.  Any further batches of 20 moves will award the timer with the third amount of time <b>(STAGE 3)</b> when they begin. If your timer reaches 0 seconds you have lost the game, so always keep an eye on how much time you have remaining (shown on your player indicator at the bottom of the screen next to your name).  When selecting the Tournament timer from the <b>Timer Mode</b> menu, you can change the Tournament timer settings by clicking on the <b>Time Controls</b> button at the bottom.<BR><BR>

<b>Average:</b> Computer Only - Non-Competitive Matches Only<BR><BR>
Using the Average timer, you can make the computer play each move in and around a given time.  This time can be changed by clicking the <b>Time Controls</b> button at the bottom of the <b>Timer Mode</b> menu when "Average" is selected.<BR><BR>

<b>Exact:</b> Computer Only - Non-Competitive Matches Only<BR><BR>
This behaves in a similar way to the Average Timer.  However, the exact timer will force the Computer player to move exactly in the time specified.  This specified time can be changed by clicking the <b>Time Controls</b> button at the bottom of the <b>Timer Mode</b> menu when "Exact" is selected.<BR><BR>

<b>Matching:</b> Computer Only - Allowed in Competitive Matches<BR><BR>
When this is the active timer for an opposition computer player, it will try to match the time taken during your last move.  This provides fair play, as both players will be taking the same amount of time for their moves.<BR><BR>

<b>Infinite:</b> Human or Computer - Non-Competitive Matches Only<BR><BR>
This timer allows the computer player all the time in the world to think and requires the human player to specify when the computer player is to move.  This can be done by using the "Move Now" option in the game menu or by pressing the "M" key while at the table.  Infinite mode is only available for the computer in practice games.  When the Infinite timer is selected for a human player, that player has no time restrictions on their moves - a good setting for beginners and casual games.<BR><BR>

<b>Play Level Based:</b> Computer Only - Non-Competitive Matches Only<BR><BR>
This is the casual timer setting for a computer player.  The player will simply take as much time as they think they need (much like a human might during a non-timed casual game).  This amount of time often depends on the play level of the opponent, hence the name.<BR><BR>

<a name="Ratings"><h1> <b> Player Ratings </b> </h1>
<P> </a>In Global Star Tournament Chess II, a player's skill 
is represented by their "Rating". This is a value between 1000 and about 3000. The higher your rating, the better you are at the game. You start with separate ratings of 1000 for each chess variant. Your rating will change as you win and lose against other players. As you progress, you can see where your rating is among other human and computer players on the ratings ladder. Your rating can never drop below 1000. </P> <br>

<a name="GainingRatings"></a><h1><b>Gaining Ratings  </b></h1>As you play the game, 
you can gain rating points by beating computer or other human 
players. However, losing games will have the opposite effect. The 
number of rating points you gain or lose depends on the rating of your opponent 
at that given time:
 <p>

<b>Playing Easy Matches </b></p> <p> 

Although choosing to play easy opponents may seem like a 
good idea for gaining ratings points, this is not usually the case. If 
you're playing a weaker player (with a lower rating than 
you), you are expected to win, so the number of rating points you gain will 
not be that great. Playing poorer players is not without some risk 
too. If you have a much higher rating than your opponent, and you 
lose to them, your rating could take a severe dent.</p>  

<p> 

<b>Playing Hard Matches </b>  

<p> 

Choosing to play a stronger player is often the best way to gain rating points. 
If you lose to them, then it was expected, and your rating won't take too much of 
a hit. Beating a stronger player will reward you with a large boost to your rating. <p>

<h1>Controls for Moving Around the Rooms:</h1><br><br>

"Tournament Chess II" provides the user with rich environments in which to play chess, ranging from a small room at home, to a large tournament area.  Each environment has a number of camera positions and useful objects to use and view.  The following controls describe how to move around these environments and manipulate these objects...<br><br>

<b>Walking around the game table</b><br><br>

Each room has a game table.  This is where you'll be playing your chess matches.  Around each table, there are 8 camera positions.  When you first enter a room, you'll begin in one of these eight positions.  To move around the table and get different views of the room, right click once.  If you right click on the left of the screen, you'll move clockwise round the table.  Right click on the right side to move anti-clockwise around.<br><br>

<b>Selecting room objects</b><br><br>

To select an object in a room (to use or view), move the mouse over it until the object highlights.  Then left click once.  Depending on the object, this will have different effects (described later).  It could range from moving to a Gramophone to put on some music or switching on a light.<br><br>

<b>Looking around</b><br><br>

At any point whilst walking through the room, you can look around on the spot.  By pressing and holding the right mouse button whilst dragging the mouse, you'll get to view the environment 360 degrees in any direction.  Use this to look for a certain room object or just to enjoy the scenery.<br><br>

<b>Viewing the Game Board</b><br><br>

If you're in the middle of playing a game of chess, left click the board to have the camera jump in closer.  You will need to do this in order to make moves.  Moves cannot be played when walking around the room.  When at the table, new camera controls come into effect (see Board Controls).<br><br><br>

<h1>Board Controls</h1><br><br>

Once a game of chess in underway and you're viewing the board, a number of new controls come into play:<br><br>

<b>Making moves</b><br><br>

The basic procedure for moving a piece is as follows:<br><br>

(1) Move the mouse over the piece you wish to move.<br><br>
(2) Press and hold the left mouse button.<br><br>
(3) Now move the mouse over the board - note how the piece you've selected moves over the board too.  If your piece moves onto a square that contains a piece you can capture, it will be pushed out of the way (so long as collision detection is switched on).<br><br>
(4) Once the piece is sitting on the square you wish to move to, release the left mouse button.<br><br>
(5) If the move wasn't legal, a message will pop up telling you so, and  the piece you moved will return to its original position ready for you to try again.  If the move was legal, it's the end of your turn.<br><br>

<b>Changing the camera angle</b><br><br>

If you desire, you can change the angle at which you view the board and pieces.  To do this, press and hold the right mouse button and drag the mouse in the desired direction.  You can also zoom in and out by using the mouse wheel, or by pressing the '+' and '-' keys.<br><br>

<b>Moving away from the board</b><br><br>

If you decide to walk about the room or to select a room object (note - room objects, such as the Gramophone and lights, cannot be selected whilst viewing the game board), you can leave the table by right clicking once.  This will make the camera jump back, and will allow you to select objects and move around the table.<br><br><br>

<h1>Additional Controls</h1><br><br>

<b>Main Menu: </b>By pressing the keyboards Escape (Esc) key (or clicking on the <b>ESC = Menu</b> button, top right) you can gain access to the main menu (see <A href="#MainMenu">Main Menu</A>)<br><br>

<a name="NetPlayIntro"></a><h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>

<p>Tournament Chess II allows you to play entire matches against other users over the internet or local network.</p>

<p>Once you have loaded your character, the <b>Net Connect</b> button will become available. From here you can select whether to host or join a game, and then select your connection options. You cannot connect if you are in the middle of a game or tournament. </p>

<p>Single matches and setup games are available over the network. However, these will not be competitive (no exchange of ratings) and the timers will be set to infinite mode.</p>

<p>Two methods of connected play are available:</p>

<p>
<tab>1) Serial (COM Port's)<br>
<tab>2) TCP/IP (Local LAN and Internet)<br>
</P>

<p>For LAN and Internet play first check that you are connected before starting
the application. You can do this by starting your web browser and verifying that
you can see the rest of your LAN or the Internet as required. You can not dial-up
the Internet from within this application.</p>

<p>Next: <A href="#NetPlayConnect"><B>Connecting</B></A></p>

<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->



<a name="NetPlayConnect"><h1>Connecting</h1></a>

<p><b>Net Connect</b> takes you to a choice dialog to either <b>HOST</b> a game or <b>JOIN</b> a game.
A game requires one Host and one Joiner. The difference is that a
Host specifies the game to be played and all the game settings.
The Joiner simply connects to the Host.</p>

<p>Once selected you are taken to the Choose Connection dialog
where you may specify how you wish to connect.</p>

<p>Next: <A href="#NetPlayConSel"><B>Connection Selection</B></A></p>

<HR><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->


<a name="NetPlayConSel"><h1>Connection Selection</h1></a>

<p>You may choose between two basic connection methods, either Serial
or TCP/IP. Within TCP/IP there are LAN and Internet connection types. These
are described in more detail below.</p>

<p><b>Serial: </b>With this type of connection, simply connect the COM
port of your machine to that of the other machine. In the Adapters section
select the COM port your cable is connected to. Ensure both computers
are correctly selected. Press the Select button and proceed to the next dialog.</p>

<p><b>TCP/IP: </b>This choice can be more complicated. Usually you only
have one Network Adapter, so only one choice is presented to you. However
if you have a network card built into your Mother Board, or have a Cable Modem
you may see two choices in the Adapter box. Select the Adapter which corresponds
to your method of connecting to the internet.</p>

<p>IP Address: The IP address, shown to the right of the Adapter is
the IP address that is assigned to your card. This may be dynamic if you
are using a dial-up service. This number should be noted as you may need to
use this later. </p>

<p>LAN Connections: The IP Address and Port number are not required when
playing over a local LAN. Ie where the other person has an IP address where
the first three numbers are the same. It is however useful to keep the
port number set to 112 to reduce the network traffic. </p>

<p>Internet connections: Where the first three digits of the IP address
are not identical, typical of a large office or Internet environment, you 
need to inform the other player of your IP address so they can connect to 
you. A joiner must type in the IP address before proceeding.</p>

<p>If you are having problems, an Internet Trouble Shooting Guide may be found
in the install directory for this product.</p>

<p>Press Select to confirm the choice. The Host and Joiner dialogs
are slightly different. Please choose the appropriate link below.</p>

<p>At this point you are ready to broadcast to any potential joiners that to are
waiting for somebody to join your game. You may personalize your Session Name which
by default is "New Game" to something more personal. This is useful if you are
playing on a local LAN at the same time as a number of other people, to distinguish
which is your game. Your Player name is also shown, and you can change
this for the purposes of the network game if you wish. When you are satisfied,
hit "Host" and wait for the other person to connect to you. When they do so, the
chat box will become activated and you can communicate with each other. You can now
select either Accept or Reject to start play or wait for somebody else to join to you.</p>

<p>Press search to find the hosts available. If you entered a specific IP address,
then there will only be one of these in the list box. Otherwise, there may be more
than one listed. Select the game you wish to join and hit "Join a Game". The list
may take some time to become populated, maybe up to 1 minute. The search stops
automatically after about 3 minutes as the search mechanism places a lot of traffic
on the network. If you don't see any hosts, press "Stop Searching" and then try
searching a few minutes later. It may well be that the host has not yet set itself
up. Once joined, you may chat with the host via the chat box. You may decline to join,
and either abort or search for another host. The host may reject you or accept you.
If the host accepts you, the box will disappear.</p>

<a name="NetPlayPlay"><h1>Once Connected</h1></a>
 
<p>Once connected, your opponents name will appear on the bottom right player indicator.  The host can start setting up a game by clicking on the chess board.  Once this is complete, the game intro dialog will pop up.  The Joining player will recieve the game information and will automatically move to the table, if not there already, and will be presented with the same game intro dialog.  They will then have the power to start the game.</P>

<p>Moves are then made in the usual way and transmitted from machine to machine.  As usual it is possible to resign the game or match from the main menu.  Note that some game features (like Hint) are disabled in Netplay to stop cheating.</P>

<p>You may also disconnect from the network at any time by hitting ESC and selecting
"Net Disconnect".</P>

<p>If during a match the network connection fails, or the other player decides to disconnect, you will be given an opportunity to either abandon the game or convert it to a local Human Vs Computer game to complete.</P>

<p>An important feature of Netplay in Tournament Chess II is the ability to chat to your opponent.  Press the ` key (usually located at the top left of the keyboard) to bring up the chat bar.  Type in your message and press return (or press the send button) to transmit your message to the other player.  This is available at all times when connected.</P>

Chess has an ancient history and has created many Chess heroes. <B>Tournament Chess II</b> provides you with many games from the top players in history. There have been many momentous draws, but it is the wins that most people remember. For this reason all the games provided are won games.<br> <br>

You can go back to the earliest recorded, starting with the Italian <b>Gioacchino Greco</b> from Rome, whose entertaining style made him the most famous and strongest player of his time in the 1600s. Moving forward, examine the games of the legendary American player <b>Morphy</b>, who reigned in the mid 1850s. Continue on through history, stepping through the games of <b>Staunton</b>, <b>Steinitz</b>, 
<b>Pillsbury</b>, <b>Lopez</b>, <b>Capablanca</b>, <b>Alekhine</b>, <b>Lasker</b>, <b>Reshevsky</b>, <b>Nimzowitsch</b>, <b>Botvinnik</b> and many others.
<br><br>
No collection would be complete without <b>Bobby Fischer</b>, so the more recent history provides some of his and his contemporaries and the players that came after him, including the strongest player of all time, <b>Kasparov</b>, and previous and current champions and top players <b>Karpov</b>, <b>Kramnik</b>, <b>Anand</b>, <b>Polgar</b>, <b>Spassky</b>, <b>Petrosian</b>, <b>Botvinnik</b>, <b>Smyslov</b>, <b>Tal</b>, <b>Korchnoi</b> and more.

As this is the modern age, we also have included a sample from the historic match between the Chess super-computer <b>Deep Blue</b> and <b>Kasparov</b>, which saw the human world champion defeated for the first time by a computer.

<a name="Engine"> </a> <h1> <b> The Chess Engine </b> </h1> 

<p><B>Tournament Chess II</b> uses the new innovative Chess engine "<b>Treebeard</b>", developed by <b>AI Factory</b>. This engine replaces <b>AI Factory</b>'s infamous "<b>Chess Tal</b>" engine, renowned for its human-like playing style. <b>Treebeard</b> analyses Chess not by using the more usual approach of examining millions of positions with a simple evaluation, but instead looks at far fewer nodes with a much more sophisticated analysis. Assessment of positions does not depend on simple rule-of-thumb rules for choosing plays, but instead analyses from first principles to assess the quality of the position. This allows <b>Treebreard</b> to find creative new ways of playing. It can create positions that might classically be considered inferior, but that offer some special advantage. <b>Treebeard</b> will therefore break the rules when it sees something interesting that it thinks works, giving the human player a much more interesting game!
<p>
Another key attribute of <b>Treebeard</b> is that it incorporates true characterization, a feature of all <b>AI Factory</b> engines. This allows the engine to play in a variety of different styles. This determines both the opening and general play style.
<p>
<b>Treebeard</b> models some aspect of human play, but also models human errors. This is more apparent in the weaker levels where the program may make "human" mistakes. Computers do not overlook captures, but <b>Treebeard</b> attaches a probability to missing each type of tactical threat and will deliberately allow such a threat to be overlooked. For example, moving a piece to an attacked square is unlikely, but moving a piece that was protecting another is something humans often do! This is a unique feature, only provided by <b>Treebeard</b>.
<p>
Importantly <b>Treebeard</b> incorporates learning, so the engine will change and improve with you. After each game <b>Treebeard</b> analyses the game and updates its knowledge, so that if it lost, then it will avoid a similar loss again. This is an important feature for a game engine, as it means the engine responds to its games, not offering identical responses each time it plays.
<p>
<b>Treebeard</b>'s design makes it possible to provide a greater range of play strengths than is normally possible in conventional Chess engines. When you take on your opponents in the matches and tournaments you will meet opponents with genuinely varying degrees of knowledge. Unlike conventional programs which simulate intelligence by making weaker opponents just play quickly to get the lower rating, <b>Treebeard</b> offers a true range of play skills not linked to the time-per-move.

Gone are the days when the user would be satisfied with simple bitmaps representing pieces, displayed on a simple matrix. Tournament Chess II provides the user with detailed models that can be manipulated in 3D space. These not only model geometry but also lighting. The surfaces of these models are not simple bitmaps, but the product of vertex shading to emulate the impact of reflections from shiny and matt surfaces. All this amounts to a product of some complexity. This is only possible because of the advent of fast sophisticated 3D hardware, which allows calculations that are thousands of time faster than could be achieved on a conventional computer.
<br><br>

<IMG src="vertex.bmp"><br>

In the example above, one of the Chess sets is shown with basic 3D modeling and again with dynamic vertex shading to emulate reflections of the 3D objects. This radically changes the appearance of the objects, which in this case turn from matt flat models into shiny metal pieces. The Chess board is transformed from a paper matt surface to a glass-like reflecting gloss. Each of these models may appear rounded and smooth, but all are composed of flat polygons. Their roundedness is generated by interpolation of shading between neighboring polygons. A single piece may be composed of some 80 such polygons, which are textured by combinations of opaque and semi translucent textures. The pieces above have side panels composed of a single polygon with a part opaque and part translucent texture, making them see-through.<p>
To create this requires testing and modeling pieces and objects in 3D modeling packages. These are then imported into a C++ based application, which displays these using DirectX. The appearance of an object may not be fully appreciated until it is shown within the target lighting environment. Feedback is then fed back to the modeler who can tweak the model and textures to achieve the desired effect. Some models are replaced or rejected because they are too costly in processing time to render. This cannot be detected until the object is seen within the product. This requires continuous design and testing loop to remove flaws and reach a good working model.

The Chess engine <b>Treebeard</b> created for <b>Tournament Chess II</b> is a new engine, designed to provide new engine technology to distinguish it from existing Chess products. Chess technology has been around for some 30 years now, and many well-known programs follow well-established techniques for creating a computer Chess player. The popular technique is to select moves by creating enormous search trees with relatively simple evaluations. This simplicity has the advantage of great speed, allowing the program to explore vast numbers of positions. This creates a play style that is fundamentally simplistic, but that will reliably avoid blunders and can easily find tactical threats that humans would miss. In consequence Chess programs are now immensely strong. The strongest commercial product can give a fairly even game to the current human World Champion.<p>
This is all very well, but most players are not that strong, and are more interested in playing interesting games, rather than playing an opponent that will routinely crush them.
<p>
<b>Treebeard</b> has been created from a background of 25 years of research into intelligent evaluation. The product of this is a program that cannot match the brute-force tactical skill of the World-championship class programs, but that can play at a very high level, but with a sophisticated evaluation. <b>Treebeard</b> has not been tested in competition, but beats the previous <b>Tournament Chess</b> product which uses the well-known "<b>Chess Tal</b>" engine. However the underlying algorithm used to drive <b>Treebeard</b> has been successfully tested in <b>AI Factory</b>'s Japanese Chess program <b>Shotest</b> that has successfully competed in 8 World Computer Shogi Championships in Tokyo. In all these events <b>Shotest</b> has been the strongest western program and twice came 3rd in the event, with 60 competing programs. In one of these years it missed becoming World champion by just one loss from 15 games played. The technology behind this relies on two key techniques developed by <b>AI Factory</b>, one of which is widely published in Academia in the West and Japan. This is SUPER-SOMA, which you can read about on the web at: <b>www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Rollason:Jeff.html</b>.
This allows complex tactical exchanges to be evaluated statically, without tree search. The other key technique is "Interest" search, which is held under wraps at AI Factory! This allows very intelligent tree search that allows complex positional evaluations to be calculated deep in the search tree. This more closely mirrors human analysis than the conventional brute force style of most Chess programs, and gives <b>Treebeard</b> its own unique play style.

<a name="Create3"> </a> <h1> <b> The Game Design Objectives</b> </h1>
 
Conventional Chess programs usually provide a single opponent that has attached play levels that get stronger by thinking for longer. This gives the user a single opponent that plays the same way for each level, but that just makes fewer mistakes. The low levels are still very strong, so many players will not be able to progress beyond these, and if they do, the quality of the games will not change significantly. This is a monochrome gaming experience.<p>
The game objective for this product is to give the user a world within which they can play, where there is genuinely variety of opponents. This does not mean that weak AI players play quickly and strong ones play slowly. With <b>Treebeard</b> there is a graduation of knowledge for each strength of opponent, so that a weak player may still take as long over their moves as the stronger opponents. Of course, if you are strong, you can directly access the strongest version of the Chess engine. However a developing player can progress more creatively by playing opponents that add increasing levels of knowledge to their play. When you learn how to beat them, your next opponent may have new knowledge that you will have to contend with.
<p>
This is all presented by attaching characters to each player. This allows the player to relate to their opponent. You may be able to beat the style of the character "Joe" very easily, but find that the maverick play style of "Harry" is harder to contend with. When you progress you will see your position among these computer opponents, who will respond as players in the tournaments by responding to match situations. An AI player that is losing a match will change their play style accordingly.
<p>
Finally, Computer Chess opponents normally do not change, so that each time you come back, and as you get stronger, they stay the same. <b>Treebeard</b> will however adapt, so that winning strategies you have used to beat opponents earlier, may no longer work as the AI opponent adapts to avoid such losses. This "understanding" is shared, so that one AI player can benefit from the knowledge of other AI players!
<p>
The end objective has been crafted to give the player more than a raw Chess engine, but a much richer gaming experience!

Behind the product is the development team. AI factory can be visited via the web site at <b>www.AIFactory.co.uk</b>, where you can find out more about the company, the products and how we work.<p>
<b>Development at AI Factory</b><p>
To create complex programs requires well-coordinated teamwork to make sure that the direction of the project stays on-course and that the end product delivers what was wanted. This required a combination of research and testing to develop the Chess engine. To make this possible <b>AI Factory</b> has an in-house AI Workbench that allows intelligent programs to be built and tested. As each version of the program is created, it can be tested at length against different version of the same program and other programs. The <b>Treebeard</b> engine has played some 80,000 games during testing, including many additional self-teaching games.<p>
The technology built for <b>Treebeard</b> is not just a one-off project, but contributes generic code that is shared by other products. It may surprise you to realise that <b>Treebeard</b> shared code with <b>AI Factory</b>'s <b>Pool and Snooker</b> program. These shared technologies allow all the products to be advanced in parallel. A breakthrough idea in one product may improve the performance of another.
<p>
A key technology developed and shared by all products is characterization. This is the generic module that allows different play styles to be modelled. Each new project undertaken inherits this technology, giving it a head start and greatly reducing development time and giving the product an enhanced richness. 
<p>
<b>AI Factory</b> functions as both a research and production company. Some work is published and Computer AI competitions competed in. We are always looking for new ideas to push forward the boundaries of intelligent gameplay!

<b>Look out for our products!</b>
